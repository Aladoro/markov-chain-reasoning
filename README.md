# Policy Gradient With Serial Markov Chain Reasoning Code

This repository contains minimal implementations of the SSPG algorithm from the NeurIPS paper **Policy Gradient With Serial Markov Chain Reasoning**. We provide two different code bases for the proprioceptive and pixel-based experiments located in the _sspg\_mujoco_ and _sspg\_dmc_ subfolders, respectively. We refer to the _README.md_ files located in these subfolders for instructions regarding installation and replicating the results.
